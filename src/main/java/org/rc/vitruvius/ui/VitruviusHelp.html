<h2> Vitruvius - A map planner for Caesar III </h2>

Vitruvius is a stand-alone program that allows the user to create graphical arrangements of
image glyphs from the Sierra game "Caesar III". It includes two tools, a Drag-and-Drop tool
and a "Glyphy" tool. This guide explains how to use them.

<h3> Drag-and-Drop Tool </h3>

This is the tool displayed at startup; it has a space for a single glyph, a button, and a set of drop-downs on the left, 
and a 'map panel' for building up a collection of glyphs on the right. 
The user selects a glyph name from a drop-down, and its
glyph appears in the box at the top left. He then moves his mouse cursor over the map panel
and the glyph moves with his mouse cursor for placement.
He positions the glyph where he wants it and clicks the left button; that places a copy of that
glyph there; he can continue to place more copies of that glyph (this
matches the behavior of placing glyphs in the game). 

<P>Once he is done with that glyph, he may clear the selected glyph by 
<ul>
<li>right-clicking the mouse, 
<li>clicking the 'Clear' button just below the image on the top left, or 
<li>pressing the keyboard's "Escape" key.
<li>choosing another glyph
</ul>

<P>For certain glyphs (road, plaza, garden, and the 3 sizes of house), when the user has
pressed the button to place the glyph, if he holds the button down and drags the mouse,
the program will reproduce the glyph each time there is room for it. This makes it easy
to create a 'line' of the same glyph.

<P>This doesn't work quite like the equivalent operation in the game. Vitruvius drops a glyph on any tile 
the mouse cursor touches that does not already have a glyph in it; it makes no attempt
to make a straight line, two lines at a right angle, or a block of the selected tile. In this
mode, every tile touched by the mouse cursor gets another copy of the selected glyph; if the
tile is already occupied, it is skipped, but tiles on the other side of an existing glyph
will still get the selected glyph if the mouse cursor continues.

<P>If the user hovers the mouse over any glyph on the map, the glyph's name is displayed.

<h4> Deleting and Moving Glyphs </h4>

To delete a glyph from the main panel, he clicks on the glyph and presses 
the "Delete" or "Backspace" key on his keyboard. Clicking on the glyph puts a black border around it, 
though that is hard to see on some glyphs.

<P>If the user wants to move a glyph, he double-clicks it; the glyph then moves with his mouse cursor
in the same way as a glyph chosen from the drop-downs. In this case, clicking to place the glyph in a 
new location then ends the dragging operation, instead of allowing placement of more glyphs of the
same kind. If the user ends the dragging operation without placing the glyph, the glyph disappears from the
board.

<h3> The Glyphy Tool </h3>

This tool is selected by clicking on the second tab in the main window; the user enters text to represent glyphs, 
using individual letters to represent each glyph. The tool then generates a map panel  
based on the letters. This functionality was available earlier to users of the Heavengames
website as a JavaScript tool with a layout limit of 40x40 'tiles', where a glyph can occupy 1 or more
tiles.

<P>Space characters and periods are placeholders in the text; for example, if the user puts down an 'r' 
for a reservoir, he can use period characters to space the rest of the 3x3 tile space so that no other glyphs
mistakenly overlap it. If there is overlap of glyphs, Vitruvius warns the user that some placement could
not be made (in the message panel at the bottom of the window), but continues to place whatever 
glyphs it can. 

<P>Any time the text is changed, the "Update Image" button is enabled; the image is only updated on user
command. There are also buttons for generating full and included HTML, as well as one for displaying a text
file containing all the characters and their corresponding glyphs. That information is put in a non-modal 
dialog, so that it can remain visible while the user enters text.

<h3> Changing Glyph Size </h3>

By either selecting the "View / Increase Image Sizes" or pressing the "Plus" or "Equals" key on the keyboard,
the user increases the size of glyphs; doing any of those options repeatedly continues to increase the size 
up to a maximum. Likewise "View / Decrease Image Sizes" or pressing the "Minus" or "Underscore" keys will
decrease the glyph sizes. There is currently no key to return to the default size, nor does the program save
the size selected between runs of the program.

<h3> Saving and Reading Files </h3>

The File options work as most programs do; "Save" stores the current glyph collection in a form the program
can read again, "Save As" allows the user to choose a different filename than was used before. "Open" reads
a previously stored file. Control-S executes the Save function, Control-O the open function.

<P> When in the Drag-and-Drop tool, the file operations read and save a text format file that represents 
the glyphs on the map panel; when in the Glyphy Tool, the file operations read and save the text from the 
text panel.
As far as is known, the glyphy tool is compatible with text used for the original JavaScript glyphy
tool, but that has not gotten substantial testing.

<h3> Generating HTML </h3>

<P>The options under the HTML menu generate HTML to display the map panel from either tool, and for either 
as a standalone web page or HTML suitable for including in the Heavengames (or another) 
forum. The current version of the program
puts the HTML text on the computer's clipboard; the user may then use the "Paste" function to put it into 
a forum post, an editor, or anywhere else that accepts a text paste operation.

<P>The displayed HTML also supports 'hovertext' indicating the glyph name, just as Vitruvius does.

<P>There are two differences between "full HTML" and "forum HTML". The "full HTML" generates an HTML file that
can be opened in a browser by itself. The "forum HTML" generates HTML that would go within another page; since
the user is already creating a web page when you he creates a post in HeavenGames and another forum,
are already a web page, they will not accept a "full HTML" page, they have to have 
HTML that was meant to go within another page.

<P>Both full and forum options must also be created to access the actual glyph files where they are located
on that system. For HeavenGames, for instance, the images are in a folder named "/strategy/housing/images/", 
so the HTML generated needs to refer to the images as being in that
folder. The program implements this with a prefix string for each tool (Drag-and-Drop and Glyphy), and puts
that string in the generated HTML. 

On the HTML menu is an "HTML Settings" menu option; clicking it displays a dialog box for setting these two values,
and for restoring their original default values. Be aware of the following if you are changing these values:

<ul>
<li>case is significant 
<li>slashes ('/') have special meaning; both values should end with a slash
<li>slashes work on Windows as well as other system; there is no need for backslashes
<li>each entry for both values should end with a slash.
</ul>

<h3> Other Tidbits </h3>

<P> The program currently limits its map to 100x100 'tiles'; some glyphs (road, garden, plaza) only
occupy one tile, others multiple (reservoirs are 3x3 tiles, markets 2x2, etc.). Allowing the user to
specify a different map size is planned as a feature.

<P> The File menu has an option for clearing the currently displayed map panel or glyph text, with a warning 
if this would lose unsaved content.

<h3>Known Problems</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Planned features</h3>

<ul>

</ul>
