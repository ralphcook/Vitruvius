<h2> Vitruvius - A layout planner for Caesar III </h2>

Vitruvius is a stand-alone program that allows the user to create graphical arrangements of
image glyphs from the Sierra game "Caesar III". This guide explains how it works.

<h3> Drag-and-Drop of Glyphs </h3>

The first panel displays a place for a single glyph and a set of drop-downs on the left, and a blank screen
for building up a collection of glyphs on the right. The user selects a glyph name from a drop-down, and its
glyph 
appears in the box at the top left. He then moves his mouse cursor over the "map panel" on the right,
and the glyph appears under his
cursor as he moves it. He positions the glyph where he wants it and clicks the left button; that places a copy of that
glyph at that place, and the glyph remains under the cursor in case he wants to place another one (this
matches the behavior of building structures in the game). 

<P>Once he is done with that glyph, he may clear that dragging operation by 
<ul>
<li>right-clicking the mouse, 
<li>clicking the 'Clear' button just below the image on the top left, or 
<li>by pressing the keyboard's "Escape" key.
</ul>

Selecting the drop-down top element ("Roads", "Houses", etc.) has no effect.

<P>Vitruvius does not currently support holding down the mouse button while dragging the glyph across the 
screen to create a line of glyphs, such as the game does with roads and plazas.

<P>If the user 'hovers' the mouse over any glyph, the name of the corresponding building is displayed.

<h3> Deleting and Moving Glyphs </h3>

If the user wants to delete a glyph from the main panel, he clicks on the glyph and presses 
the "Delete" or "Backspace" key on his keyboard. Clicking on the glyph puts a black border around it, 
though that is hard to see on some glyphs.

<P>If he wants to move a glyph, he double-clicks it; the glyph then moves with his mouse cursor
in the same way as a glyph chosen from the drop-downs. In this case, clicking to place the glyph in a 
new location then ends the dragging operation, instead of allowing placement of more glyphs of the
same kind.

<h3> Changing Glyph Size </h3>

By either selecting the "View / Increase Image Sizes" or pressing the "Plus" or "Equals" key on the keyboard,
the user increases the size of glyphs; doing any of those options repeatedly continues to increase the size 
up to a maximum. Likewise "View / Decrease Image Sizes" or pressing the "Minus" or "Underscore" keys will
decrease the glyph sizes. There is currently no key to return to the default size, nor does the program save
the size selected between runs of the program.

<h3> Saving and Reading Files </h3>

The File options work as most programs do; "Save" stores the current glyph collection in a form the program
can read again, "Save As" allows the user to choose a different filename than was used before. "Open" reads
a previously stored file. Control-S executes the Save function, Control-O the open function.

<h3> Generating HTML </h3>

<P>The program will generate HTML suitable for including in the Heavengames (or other) forum, and also HTML
that is a complete standalone web page. Use the options under the HTML menu. The current version of the program
puts the HTML text on the computer's clipboard; the user may then use the "Paste" function to put it into an
editor or anywhere else that accepts a paste operation.

<P>The displayed HTML also supports 'hovertext' indicating the building name, just as Vitruvius does. 

<h3> The Glyphy Tool </h3>

By clicking on the second tab in the main window, the user can enter text to represent glyphs and have 
Vitruvius generate 
the layout based on that text - this functionality was available earlier to users of the Heavengames
website as a JavaScript tool with a layout limit of 40x40 'tiles', where a glyph can occupy 1 or more
tiles.

<P>space characters and periods are placeholders in the text; for example, if the user puts down an 'r' 
for a reservoir, he can use period characters to space the rest of the 3x3 tile space so that no other glyphs
mistakenly overlap it. If there is overlap of glyphs, Vitruvius warns the user that some placement could
not be made, but continues to place whatever glyphs occupy their corresponding places first. 

<P>Any time the text is changed, the "Update Image" button is enabled; the image is only updated on user
command. There are also buttons for generating full and included HTML, as well as one for displaying a text
file containing all the characters and their corresponding glyphs. That information is put in a non-modal 
dialog, so that it can remain visible while the user enters text.

<P> File Open/Save/Save As, used when the glyphy tool panel is up, all work on text files containing the 
glyphy text. As far as is known at the moment, this is compatible with text used for the original glyphy
tool, but that has not been tested much.  

<h3> Other Tidbits </h3>

<P> The program currently limits its space to 100x100 'tiles'; some glyphs (road, garden, plaza) only
occupy one tile, others multiple (reservoirs are 3x3 tiles, markets 2x2, etc.). Allowing the user to
specify a different map size is planned as a feature.

<P> There is also an option for clearing the map panel currently displayed, with a warning if it contains
unsaved content.
