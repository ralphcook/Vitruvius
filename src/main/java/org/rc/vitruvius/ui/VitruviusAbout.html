This all started with the Glyphy Tool, available on the
Heavengames website "Caesar III Heaven" 
(https://caesar3.heavengames.com). Some person(s) there
conceived of using text to generate a graphical
representation of portions of Caesar III maps, and
created a web-based JavaScript tool to do so. It
was used extensively to illustrate "housing blocks"
so we governors could 
help market ladies and prefects stay focused on 
their jobs and not go gallivanting across the province
to gossip with other citizens. Along the way,
someone(s) at Heavengames created all the glyphs 
used in the initial version
of this program. 

<P>Many thanks!

<P>I conceived of and created the Drag and Drop tool
as a more convenient way of creating those maps, and included
the same HTML output as a way of communicating the maps
on the forum. If there is interest, its text can be
translated to other languages, and the code packaged
for other systems.

<h3>Vitruvius</h3>

From Wikipedia:

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Marcus Vitruvius Pollio 
(c. 80-70BC until after c. 15BC), commonly known as Vitruvius, 
was a Roman author, architect, civil and military engineer 
during the 1st century BC, known for his multi-volume work 
entitled De architectura.[1] His discussion of perfect 
proportion in architecture and the human body led to the 
famous Renaissance drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of 
Vitruvian Man. He was also the one who, in 40 BC, invented 
the idea that all buildings should have three attributes: 
firmitas, utilitas, and venustas, meaning: strength, 
utility, and beauty.[2] These principles were later 
adopted by the Romans.
