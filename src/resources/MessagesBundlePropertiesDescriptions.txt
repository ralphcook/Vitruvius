OkButtonText: generic button label for confirmation; generally means "accept action

GlyphyHelpTextFilename: name of the file containing help text showing the letters 
corresponding to each glyph. For other locales, the filename should use the same 
filename with suffixes to indicate language and country, with underscores between

conventions used for ResourceBundle files. e.g., a French language locale would be
named "GlyphyHelpText_de.txt", and then "GlyphyHelpText_de" would be the value for
this key in the "MessagesBundle_de.properties" file.
