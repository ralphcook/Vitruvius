Vitruvius punch list.
---------------------

tileSize -- currently hard-coded in the images pane, the panel containing the
images pane does not have a variable for tilesize at the moment. Tile size 
makes sense for both of the display panels, but they don't need to be the same
and it might be useful if they changed separately. 

The action from a combo box selection creates a DraggablePicture, then calls
'activateDragging' on the mapPane to set it as the 'current draggable'. 

Menu bar:

File
	open
	save
	close
	exit
Images
	set window size
	decrease tile size
	increase tile size
Glyphy tool
	update image panel
HTML
	generate full HTML
	generate forum HTML
Help
	program help
	credits

Save file: probably separate for dragndrop & glyph, possibly save glyphy text,
certainly HTML.

Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement moving existing glyphs

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

implement multiple glyph selection?

When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel

Button to clear panel?
