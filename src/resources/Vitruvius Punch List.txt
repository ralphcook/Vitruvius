Vitruvius punch list.
---------------------

implement glyph selection, one (and later multiple?)


When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

prevent overlap of glyphs

Instead of JLabels on the panel, create underlying dynamic
list-of-lists as for glyphy tool? Or in addition to?

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel
