Vitruvius punch list.
---------------------

* implement tileArray to hold glyphs built up on dragndrop panel.

* prevent overlap of glyphs

* tooltip labels are incorrect

* moving cursor off imagepanel to left (and selecting another glyph) 
* sometimes causes first glyph to appear at left edge of imagepanel.

* implement highlighting and deleting (single) existing glyphs

Save file: probably seprarate for dragndrop & glyph, possibly save glphy text,
certainly HTML.

Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement moving existing glyphs

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

implement multiple glyph selection?

When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel

Button to clear panel?
