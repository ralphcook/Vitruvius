Vitruvius punch list.
---------------------

Do file extensions need to be internationalized?

prevent writing in the messages text area -- perhaps provide a way to clear it of text entirely.

*get the map images panel sizing straightened out. We might need to display it
as an x-by-y tile count or something. 

Menu bar: '*' for menus applying to both working panes, 'G' for glyphy tool only.

implement preferences for the glyphy tool -- currently commented out, see TODO lines.

*	decrease tile size
*	increase tile size
G	update image panel
G	transfer Image to DnD
HTML

*	credits / about

from Bianca:
	*put the cursor back on the screen when dragging a building.
	*scrollable left pane on DnD
	*additional button for deleting, maybe backspace
	*first item in dropdowns somehow? selecting top one twice seems weird.
	*right-click not easy on map, make another way to do that. Escape?
	drag buildings already on map.
	

*Set up key bindings for hot keys.

*Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

*implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement clicking-and-dragging glyphs already on the panel

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

tileSize -- currently hard-coded in the images pane, the panel containing the
images pane does not have a variable for tilesize at the moment. Tile size 
makes sense for both of the display panels, but they don't need to be the same
and it might be useful if they changed separately.

implement multiple glyph selection?

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

organize messages in MessagesBundle Properties; 
transfer documentation to properties file

Button to clear panel?

glyphs to add: well, aqueduct(h&v), boatyard

*track whether image being built has changed since last read/write,
warn on exit/read

Larger font for messages text panel.

There's something funny about the messages text panel sizing / scroll bars

*implement scrolledpane for left and middle DnD panels

*if a file is opened, make that file default for saving.

*might separate 'file save' from 'file save as'

*idea: FileAction class, with action names for save, open, saveAs

*idea: FileHandling class, an instance could hold current files,
most recent files, etc.
