certainly HTML.

Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement moving existing glyphs

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

implement multiple glyph selection?

When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel

Button to clear panel?
