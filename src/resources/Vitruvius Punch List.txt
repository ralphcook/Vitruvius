When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement clicking-and-dragging glyphs already on the panel

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

tileSize -- currently hard-coded in the images pane, the panel containing the
images pane does not have a variable for tilesize at the moment. Tile size 
makes sense for both of the display panels, but they don't need to be the same
and it might be useful if they changed separately.

implement multiple glyph selection?

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel

Button to clear panel?
