Vitruvius punch list.
---------------------

Currently going through all the classes to check for leftover artifacts from 
working out the File Open bug, or other, fixing occasional problems.

tileSize -- currently hard-coded in the images pane, the panel containing the
images pane does not have a variable for tilesize at the moment. Tile size 
makes sense for both of the display panels, but they don't need to be the same
and it might be useful if they changed separately. 

The action from a combo box selection creates a DraggablePicture, then calls
'activateDragging' on the mapPane to set it as the 'current draggable'. 

Menu bar: ('*' next to options that might apply to both DnD and Glyphy panes)

File
*	open
*	save
*	close (or clear?)
-	exit
Images
*	set window size
*	decrease tile size
*	increase tile size
	update image panel (glyphy only)
	transfer Image to DnD
HTML
*	generate full HTML
*	generate forum HTML
Help
*	program help
*	credits

Save file: probably separate for dragndrop & glyph, possibly save glyphy text,
certainly HTML.

Consider key bindings instead of key listener dependent on focus.

implement image panel sizing, with scroll bars where necessary. 

implement moving existing glyphs

Implement sending tile size into GlassPaneWrapper from 
DragNDrop panel, and allowing the user to change the tile size

implement multiple glyph selection?

When right-click clears the current glyph, clear from left panel

implement dragging of cursor to create line of glyphs.
Should that be limited to certain glyphs?

Implement tooltip for left panel and for main image panel

Button to clear panel?
